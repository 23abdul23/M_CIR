# Backend Changes for Voice Analysis Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the backend system to integrate advanced voice analysis capabilities with the existing Warrior Support System.

### 1. `python-backend/app.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Added global initialization of AI components to prevent model reloading
- Enhanced `/api/translate` endpoint with voice analysis integration
- Added weighted assessment calculation in translate endpoint
- Improved error handling and logging for audio processing
- Added `/api/save-ai-assessment` endpoint for storing AI results
- Fixed file handling to prevent conflicts between transcription and voice analysis

**Key Additions:**
```python
# Global AI component initialization
enhanced_voice_processor = EnhancedVoiceProcessor()
advanced_voice_analyzer = AdvancedVoiceMentalHealthAnalyzer()
weighted_assessment_engine = WeightedAIAssessmentEngine()

# Enhanced translate endpoint with voice analysis
voice_analysis_results = advanced_voice_analyzer.calculate_mental_health_scores(voice_features)
weighted_results = weighted_assessment_engine.calculate_comprehensive_scores(...)
```

### 2. `python-backend/models/enhanced_voice_processor.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Modified transcription to use Hindi language for better Hinglish support
- Removed automatic file deletion to prevent conflicts
- Added better error handling for audio format conversion
- Optimized Whisper model parameters for short audio clips

**Key Modifications:**
```python
# Force Hindi language for Hinglish support
result = self.whisper_model.transcribe(
    temp_path,
    language="hi",
    condition_on_previous_text=False
)
```

### 3. `python-backend/models/advanced_voice_mental_health.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed syntax errors and corrupted code sections
- Improved feature extraction pipeline
- Enhanced mental health scoring algorithms
- Added confidence calculation based on feature quality

**Key Fixes:**
- Removed malformed docstring and class definition
- Fixed unterminated triple-quoted string literals
- Improved error handling in feature extraction

### 4. `python-backend/models/weighted_ai_assessment.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed dictionary iteration bug that caused runtime errors
- Improved weighted scoring calculation
- Enhanced risk assessment algorithms
- Added comprehensive assessment quality metrics

**Key Fix:**
```python
# Fixed iteration over changing dictionary
categories = ['depression', 'anxiety', 'stress']  # Use fixed list
for category in categories:
    final_scores[f'{category}_severity'] = severity
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. `src/components/CombinedAssessment.jsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed port configuration from 8000 to 8001 for Python backend
- Added comprehensive error handling for audio recording
- Implemented processing state management to prevent page reloads
- Enhanced voice recording with better format support
- Added visual indicators for audio processing status
- Removed automatic navigation after assessment completion

**Key Additions:**
```javascript
// Fixed port configuration
axios.post('http://localhost:8001/api/translate', formData)

// Added processing state management
const [isProcessingAudio, setIsProcessingAudio] = useState(false);

// Enhanced button event handling
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  handleFunction();
}}
```

### 2. `src/components/DataTable_CO.jsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Added AI assessment results display alongside manual results
- Implemented dual assessment view (Manual + AI)
- Added assessment type indicators
- Enhanced results table with confidence scores and component weights

**Key Additions:**
```javascript
// Dual assessment display
const aiResult = aiResults.find(ai => ai.armyNo === person.armyNo);

// Assessment type indicators
{hasManual && hasAI ? (
  <div>ðŸ“‹ Manual + ðŸ¤– AI Enhanced</div>
) : hasAI ? (
  <div>ðŸ¤– AI Only</div>
) : (
  <div>ðŸ“‹ Manual Only</div>
)}
```
